    <p>
                Web Design has been my main interest since 2001/2002 when as a young twelve or thirteen year old I
                frequented one of the early Harry Potter fansites and wanted to make my own, my first websites were
                rubbish, but I never gave up, over the next year or so I started learning HTML and the then normal table
                based layouts, then when I turned 15 and did my Work Experience through school I started learning PHP
                and MySQL, when table layouts started dying out in the mid-to-late 2000s I started learning CSS and
                making my first DIV based layouts, and since then I have always kept learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                <jp-image src="http://jamie-peters.test/assets/images/laravel-logo.png" alt="Laravel" :zoomable="false" classes="w-1/3 max-w-200px float-right ml-2 my-2"></jp-image>
                Within the past 5 years or so I started learning more Object Orientated PHP an applying to to my
                projects, and later within the last couple of years I started learning and using Laravel more, which I
                have now become a bit of an enthusiast for, and I have also been using TDD with my Laravel projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Coupled with learning Laravel I have also started using Tailwind CSS more instead of writing my own
                traditional CSS files, and I have also learnt the Vue Javascript framework and started adopting this
                into my own projects too.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the past few years I've come to the conclusion that I prefer the development side of Web
                Applications, writing the code that powers the software behind the scenes rather than the front end and
                the look and feel, but I am capable of working on the front end too, but my passion is as a back end
                developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of Web Development my other main interests include photography, whenever I am out with my
                Fiancee and her family I always have my camera with me, I use a combination of Adobe Lightroom and Adobe
                Photoshop to post-process my photos, then the very best end up on my
                <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jpeters8889/sets" target="_blank">Flickr Stream</a>.

                I also love to travel, which helps with my photography, I'm also a little bit of an adrenaline junkie, I
                love Roller Coasters and thrill rides, along with my mother in law I completed the <a href="https://www.zipworld.co.uk/adventure/velocity" target="_blank">Velocity 2</a> zip wire at
                Penrhyn Quarry in North Wales, the fastest zipslide in the world at over 100mph, and the longest in
                Europe, in the process we raised over &pound;1,600 for the Critical Care Unit at Royal Stoke Hospital after my
                <jp-image src="http://jamie-peters.test/assets/images/zipslide-cheque.jpg" alt="My partner (far left), me, and my mother in law (middle) with staff in the Critical Care ward at Royal Stoke Hopistal handing a cheque over for over &pound;1600" classes="w-1/2 max-w-300px float-right ml-2 my-2"></jp-image>
                father in law spent a considerable amount of time there following a severe Stroke, I have also always
                wanted to do a bungee jump or skydive, but unfortunately I have never had the opportunity...
                <strong>yet</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am also a music lover, particularly rock and the punk/pop punk sub genres, I have been playing guitar
                since Christmas 2009 and attend a lot of concerts to see my favourite bands live, which also comes into
                the love of travelling as I have attended concerts up and down the country and have followed my
                favourite bands around on tour in the past.
