        Coeliac Sanctuary is my fianceeâ€™s business, it was originally started in August 2014 as just
        Gluten Free blog for the Coeliac community, along with recipes, places to eat guide and reviews.
    </p>
    <p>
        Later in 2016 I created an online shop for the website, using raw vanilla PHP and utilising the
        Stripe and PayPal APIs for handling payments.
    </p>
    <p>
        A basic mobile app was created using Phone Gap, primarily for the places to eat section on the
        website, to display places in our database on a map around the users location. The app was
        originally written in basic HTML, SCSS and JQuery.

        I am currently in the process of a creating new major version of the website, including
        rewriting all the code from scratch using TDD and the Laravel Framework along with Tailwind CSS
        and Vue Components, also creating a new MySQL data structure for the website and writing scripts
        to import and migrate the existing data structure into the new Laravel version.
    </p>
    <p>
        This newest rebuild has seen all images moved onto Amazon S3 for easier storage, and the current
        plan is to host the website on AWS using Laravel Vapor.
    </p>
    <p>
        Access to the private repository can be given on request, and dependent on the state of the
        project timeline, the project may be able to be viewed on a development server.
